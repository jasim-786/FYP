      "chemical": [
        "Propiconazole (25% EC) at 1 ml/L water",

      "biological": [
        "Apply Trichoderma harzianum as foliar spray",

    "prevention": [
      "Use rust-resistant wheat varieties (e.g., PBW 343, HD 2967)",

    "economicThreshold": "When 10% or more plants show symptoms during active growth stage",
    "traditionalPractices": [
      "Application of wood ash to affected foliage",
